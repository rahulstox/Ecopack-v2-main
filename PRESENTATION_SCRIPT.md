### 4) Who It’s For

- Individuals who want a practical path to reduce CO2e.
- Teams and communities that want to run challenges and measure collective impact.

### 11) Data & Privacy

- We only store the minimum needed to power recommendations and tracking.
- Users can view their data via the action log and reports.
- We aim for clear consent and the ability to opt out.

### 12) Impact Methodology (Short)

- We source factors from reputable datasets and document assumptions.
- Baselines and savings are estimates; we optimize for clarity and consistency.

### 13) Common Questions (Fast Answers)

- How accurate are the numbers? They’re estimates using published factors; we’re transparent and continually improving.
- Can this work for teams? Yes. We’re building collaborative features and shared goals.
- Does it work offline? You can queue actions; data syncs when online (roadmap dependent).
- Can I export my data? Exports are planned so users can keep or analyze their data.

### 14) Short Story to Tell
