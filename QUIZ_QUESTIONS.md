## Sustainability & Climate Quiz Bank (with Answers)

Use these for the in‑app quiz and as a quick study sheet.

1. What is CH4 commonly called?

- Answer: Methane
- Note: Potent greenhouse gas; major sources include livestock, rice paddies, and fossil fuels.

2. Over 100 years, methane (CH4) is roughly how many times more warming than CO2?

- Answer: ~28× (GWP100 ≈ 28–34)

3. What does CO2e stand for?

- Answer: Carbon dioxide equivalent
- Note: Lets us compare different greenhouse gases on a common scale using GWP.

4. Which sector is the largest source of global methane emissions?

- Answer: Agriculture (e.g., livestock, rice)

5. Which refrigerant group has very high GWPs and is being phased down globally?

- Answer: HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons)

6. What does GWP (Global Warming Potential) compare?

- Answer: The cumulative warming of a gas relative to CO2 over a chosen time horizon (e.g., 100 years)

7. If organic waste decomposes without oxygen (anaerobically), which gas is produced in high amounts?

- Answer: Methane

8. Which material generally has the lowest carbon footprint for packaging?

- Answer: Cardboard (recycled)

9. How long does it take for a plastic bottle to decompose?

- Answer: ~450 years (or more)

10. What is the environmental benefit of using recycled packaging?

- Answer: All of the above (saves water, reduces energy, lowers emissions)

11. Which certification ensures paper/cardboard comes from responsibly managed forests?

- Answer: FSC

12. What makes packaging “biodegradable”?

- Answer: All of the above (breaks down naturally, meets compostable/biodegradable standards, etc.)

13. Which is more sustainable: single‑use or reusable packaging?

- Answer: Depends on material and use (life‑cycle impacts matter)

14. Which is the most recyclable common packaging material?

- Answer: Aluminum (infinite recyclability without quality loss)

15. Composting tips to avoid methane?

- Answer: Keep it aerobic (turn pile, ensure airflow, maintain moisture)
